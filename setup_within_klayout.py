"""
Installs required packages and creates symlinks, so that kqcircuits can be used in KLayout Editor.
This assumes that a prebuilt KLayout has already been installed in the default location, and that KLayout has been
opened at least once (because that creates the KLayout python folder).
This also assumes that pip is available in the shell where you run this.

Usage:

    (in Windows the command line must be opened with admin privileges)

    > cd directory_where_this_file_is

    > python3 setup_within_klayout.py
    (depending on your OS and Python setup, may need to replace "python3" by "py" or "python", but make sure it refers
    to Python 3)
